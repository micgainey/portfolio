# Hello there! I'm Michael.

I am an inspiring front-end dev that is working on getting my first job.

I love learning new technologies and using them to create interesting projects that are releveant to my interests. I enjoy solving problems and coming up with unique solutions to make my life a little easier. I am always looking to improve so if you have any tips get in touch!



Currently I have been using mostly javascript and dabbling with typescript.

Other than that a few of the projects I worked on are:
- [ghg-tracker](https://github.com/hot-n-code/ghg-tracker)
- [eco-camino](https://github.com/HACC-Camino/eco-camino)
- [HMARCamino](https://github.com/HACC2021/HACCamino)

**eco-camino** and **HMARCamino** were both hackathon projects that won first place!
